*   **Administrative Overload:** Teachers and administrators spend too much time on manual tasks like attendance, fee tracking, and communication.
*   **Communication Gap:** Parents often feel disconnected from their child's day-to-day academic life.
*   **Data Fragmentation:** Important information (schedules, results, fees) is scattered across different systems (or paper records), making it hard to get a clear picture.
*   **Student Disengagement:** Students lack a single, reliable source for their schedules, test dates, and study materials.
